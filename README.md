# Conuhacks 2025

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project tied in with the hackathon's general theme of a wild west environment. We wanted to create a game that showcases wild west themes that are generally depicted in pop culture while not being too complicated. 

## What it does
Our project is a small unity game for users to play party games, shooting minigames and complete a short story along the way. As an outlaw traveling the towns, his trusty stallion breaks down, in his desperation the outlaw must gather enough money by playing mini games to repair his steed. During the outlaw's adventure, he makes some enemies.

## How we built it
We built our project with Unity (2D) and C# with related sprites done with Aseprite. Assets were acquired from sources like [itch.io](itch.io) and [opengameart.org](opengameart.org). Our workflow consisted of splitting tasks into mini-games to parallelize development. 

## Challenges we ran into
Due to the limited exposure to the Unity software within our group, difficulties were bound to arise with certain assets, collisions and game logic. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite our difficulties we were able to section our project into mini games which allowed for a more digestible approach to the game. This allowed a natural flow through our game which fathered more unique ideas during the creation. The collective brainstorming and collaborative environment we were able to construct while tackling a unique challenge to us was something we are proud of being apart of.

## What we learned
We learnt that projects can evolve drastically and become chaotic, however, it is best to remain organized and open minded to possible additions or subtractions to our project. Our original gameplan changed more times than we could remember and that's okay! 

## What's next for The Outlaw
Despite being accomplished with the results provided in our time frame, we would be more than interested in exploring different ideas that we had proposed amongst ourselves but did not complete in time. These ideas were adding more games like wild west style duels, poker games and quick time bottle shooting mini games, as well as including more enemies along with these mini games. This is something we are more than interested in pursuing on our personal time!
